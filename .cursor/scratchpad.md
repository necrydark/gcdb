# Character Liking System Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation
The application currently has a database schema that supports favoriting characters, but the functionality isn't fully implemented. This feature will allow users to "like" characters, view their liked characters in their profile, and see how many likes each character has received from the community.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Database Schema**: 
   - The application already has a `Favourite` model that links characters to users
   - The model includes a timestamp for when the like was created

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Need to create server actions to add/remove likes
   - Need to fetch like counts and user's like status for characters

3. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Add a like button to the character detail page
   - Show like counts on character cards
   - Update UI when a user likes/unlikes a character
   - Display liked characters on the user's profile page

4. **Authentication**:
   - Like functionality should only be available to authenticated users
   - The app uses NextAuth for authentication

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Backend: Create Server Actions for Like Functionality**
   - Implement a server action to like a character
   - Implement a server action to unlike a character
   - Implement a server action to get like count for a character
   - Implement a server action to check if a user has liked a character
   - Success criteria: All server actions return expected results and handle errors appropriately

2. **Frontend: Character Detail Page Like Button**
   - Create a like button component with appropriate styling
   - Implement state management for the like button 
   - Add the like button to the character detail page
   - Show the current like count
   - Success criteria: Users can like/unlike characters and see immediate feedback

3. **Frontend: Profile Page Liked Characters**
   - Update the profile page to fetch and display the user's liked characters
   - Improve the existing profile page UI for displaying liked characters
   - Success criteria: Users can see all their liked characters on their profile page

4. **Testing and Bug Fixing**
   - Test like/unlike functionality with different users
   - Test edge cases (e.g., rapid clicking, network issues)
   - Fix any bugs discovered during testing
   - Success criteria: All features work as expected across different scenarios

## Project Status Board

- [ ] Backend: Create Server Actions for Like Functionality
- [ ] Frontend: Character Detail Page Like Button  
- [ ] Frontend: Profile Page Liked Characters
- [ ] Testing and Bug Fixing

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
N/A - Planning phase

## Lessons
- The database schema already includes a `Favourite` model with appropriate relationships to `Character` and `User`
- The application uses a combination of server-side and client-side authentication methods
- The codebase uses server actions for API calls
